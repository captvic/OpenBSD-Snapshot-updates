* Readme

This is a set of scripts to make updating to the latest OpenBSD snapshot 
a little easier. One fetches the latest snapshot binaries, and the other
simply puts the bsd.rd boot kernel into place.

Both take the option -h for more information.

get_snapshot.sh

  This script downloads the necessary files to update your system to
  the latest OpenBSD snapshot. Files are downloaded from the mirror
  set in OPENBSD_MIRROR, and their checksums are verified. Note that
  SHA256 is always downloaded from ftp.openbsd.org, and that the script
  will stop as soon as any checksum does not match.

prepare_for_upgrade.sh

  This script asks to do several things you probably don't want
  to do, but might. In order:
    1) Move the bsd.rd in the appropriate snapshot dir to /.
       A backup is made of bsd.rd
    2) Make a backup of /etc in a dated directory.
    3) Delete X11 Modules.
    4) Fetch latest ports.tar.gz

This is a set of scripts to make updating to the latest OpenBSD snapshot 
a little easier. One fetches the latest snapshot binaries, and the other
simply puts the bsd.rd boot kernel into place.

Both take the option -h for more information.

get_snapshot.sh

  This script downloads the necessary files to update your system to
  the latest OpenBSD snapshot. Files are downloaded from the mirror
  set in OPENBSD_MIRROR, and their checksums are verified.


setup_snapshot.sh

  This will simply move the current /bsd.rd to /obsd.rd and copy the
  new bsd.rd to /. This requires you to be root or use sudo
